# Fifteen Puzzle Game project

#Introduction:
This project aimed to develop a sliding puzzle game that included four extra features: multiple 
backgrounds, end-of-game notification, game time and music, and extra animation. The project 
was completed by Aditya Rajani and Milin Gujrati using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
# Overview:
The project was challenging as the team had to ensure that the game had basic functionality and 
four additional features. Some challenges encountered included finding time to discuss the 
project as a team and fixing bugs related to the records table and end-game notification.
# Project Timeline:
The project was completed within four weeks.
Week 1:
• Brainstormed ideas and divided the workload equally
• Created a roadmap of tasks to be completed each week to ensure the project was ready by 
the deadline
Week 2:
• Focused on game functionality, such as randomizing the image, breaking it into 16 tiles, 
and shuffling the tiles
• Worked on basic game structure
Week 3:
• Coded the game's backend using JavaScript
• Developed the game function, user interface design, and additional features like multiple 
backgrounds, music, and a timer
• Ensured compatibility with different web browsers and operating systems
Week 4:
• Conducted testing of the game and identified minor bugs
• Fixed the bugs and made final touches to the game
• Prepared presentation, video, and wrote the project summary
# Risk and Challenges:
Developing a game with additional features comes with its own set of risks and challenges. Here 
are some of the main risks and challenges the team encountered during the project:
1. Time Constraints: One of the main challenges the team faced was finding time to work 
together and discuss the project's overall structure. Additionally, as the project deadline 
approached, there was pressure to complete the project on time.
2. Bugs and Technical Issues: While writing the code for the actual game and game 
functions, the team encountered several bugs and technical issues, such as the records 
table not taking any records, the end-game notification not popping up, and more.
3. User Interface Design: The team had to design a user interface that was not only visually 
appealing but also user-friendly. It was challenging to ensure that the interface was easy 
to navigate, especially for new players.
4. Incorporating Extra Features: The team had to incorporate additional features into the 
game, such as multiple backgrounds, music, and animations. While these features added 
value to the game, they also required additional time and effort to implement.
5. Compatibility Issues: The team had to ensure that the game was compatible with different 
web browsers and operating systems, which was challenging as different browsers and 
operating systems may have different settings and requirements.
Despite these challenges, the team was able to overcome them and deliver a functional game 
with additional features. The project required collaboration, creativity, and hard work, but the 
team was able to complete it successfully.
# Conclusion:
Overall, the project was a success. The team was able to incorporate basic game functionality 
and four extra features. The project required collaboration and hard work, but the team was able 
to complete it within the given timeline
